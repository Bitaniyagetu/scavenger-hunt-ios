## Notes

Challenges encountered while building the app included working with Auto Layout constraints for full-screen images, properly registering and using custom map annotation views, and ensuring data flowed correctly between view controllers. Debugging navigation controller behavior and map annotations helped strengthen understanding of UIKit and MapKit concepts.
